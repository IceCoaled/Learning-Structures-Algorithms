# Learning Data Structures & Algorithms
This Repo was my learning for some computers sience basic's for
data structures and algorithms.

### Things Included To Learn About
- Base / derived classes
- High resolution timing with steady clock
- Sorting algorithms ( bubble sort, selection sort, insertion Sort, quick Sort, merge Sort )
- Searching algorithms( linear, binary, sliding window, breadth-first, depth-first )
- Linked list, merge sort and searching algorithms
- Binary tree ( i use newer cpp stuff for setting this up)
- Binary tree traversal methods( in Order, pre order, post order )
- In order traversal is what is used for depth first searching as well
- Abstract functions
- Template concepts
- Conditional noexcept
- cpp20/23 heavy features things in binary tree headers( i think in search there is newer things as well)
- std::optional, std::expected, std::generator, std::coroutines
- starship operator<=> and its includes strong, weak, partial ordering
- Im sure there is a bunch of random things you might find and im missing

### Requirements
- cpp23( for visual studio. project->properties->
  Configuration Properties->General->C++ Language Standard->Preview
  For cmd Line its '/std:c++latest')
- Should be able to run for anyone
- Standard library use only.

### Future
- Im finished with this for now. With that being said,
i might find something interesting in this
scope and add it to this repo
